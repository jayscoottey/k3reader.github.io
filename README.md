I'm just testing things for now.


Things to note:

    -The Kindle Keyboard's browser has limitations. It only supports JavaScript ES3 (1999).
        -Eventlistener not supported, use onclick instead
        -can't use 'let' or 'const' to declare variables, only use 'var', or just assign automatically? idk what's good practice
        -no fetch() function, use xhttp requests instead
